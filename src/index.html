  Note: apart from the key words even and odd, the nth-child puedo selector takes an expression that evaluates to a value.
  Also to note that 'n' can take the value of 0,1,2,3 and so on.

  So when you are creating an expression:

  (5) = 5th element


  //
  3n
  Resolves to:

  3 x 0 = 0th element
  3 x 1 = 1st element
  3 x 2 = 2nd element
  3 x 3 = 3rd element


  //
  3n + 4

  3 x 0 + 4 = 4th element
  3 x 1 + 4 = 7th element
  3 x 2 + 4 = 10th element
  3 x 3 + 4 = 12th element


  //
  nth-child(n+6) // child items 6 and above
  
  0 + 6 = 6th element
  1 + 6 = 7th element
  2 x 6 = 8th element
  3 x 6 = 9th element


  // 
  nth-child(-n+5) // first five
  
  - 0 + 5 = 5th element
  - 1 + 5 = 4th element
  - 2 x 5 = 3th element
  - 3 x 5 = 2th element
